# 🎯 COMPLETE APPLICATION FLOW - FIXED AND TESTED

## ✅ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED

### **Problem 1: Missing Deposit Amount Field** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: User couldn't enter deposit amount
- **Solution**: Added clear "Deposit Amount (USD)" field in Step 4
- **Location**: Step 4 - Move-In & Payment
- **Field**: `securityDepositAmount`

### **Problem 2: Edge Function Errors** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Form fields didn't match database schema
- **Solution**: Updated `submit-application` Edge Function to handle:
  - New field names (`securityDepositAmount` instead of `depositAmount`)
  - New field names (`monthlyIncome` instead of `income`)
  - New address structure (`currentAddress`)
  - Boolean pet field converted to number
- **Validation**: Added check for deposit amount > 0

### **Problem 3: Not Routing to Payment Page** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Flow wasn't clear
- **Solution**: When Bitcoin is selected, button changes to "Proceed to Face Capture" and routes directly

## 🚨 COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### **Issue: "Edge Function returned non-2xx status code"**
**Cause**: Missing or invalid deposit amount
**Solution**: ✅ FIXED - Deposit amount field now required in Step 4

### **Issue: "depositAmount is undefined"**
**Cause**: Form field name changed to `securityDepositAmount`
**Solution**: ✅ FIXED - Edge Function now handles both old and new field names

### **Issue: "Bitcoin address not showing"**
**Cause**: BTCPay secrets not set in Supabase
**Solution**: Run `npx supabase secrets list` to verify:
- BTCPAY_API_KEY
- BTCPAY_STORE_ID
- BTCPAY_URL

### **Issue: "Application not found"**
**Cause**: tempId not being passed correctly
**Solution**: ✅ FIXED - navigate uses template literal with tempId
